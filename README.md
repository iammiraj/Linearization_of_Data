<h1 align="center"> Linearization of Data </h1>

<br>

Linearization is finding the linear approximation to a function at a given point. Linearizations of a function are lines, usually lines that can be used for purposes of calculation. Linearization is an effective method for approximating the output of a function y = f(x)

This program can be used to linearize various types of data like_ Linear Data, Exponential Data, Power Model, Saturation Growth Model.
The Goodness of Fit can be also measured.
